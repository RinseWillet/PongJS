# PongJS
experiment to recreate classic Pong in JS

the basis was this tutorial by Matt Mongeau (https://thoughtbot.com/blog/pong-clone-in-javascript)
the game has been turned 90 degrees and colors matched to conform to classic 1972 pong.

recent work:
centre line / net added
synthesizer added to make beep sounds

to do:
- add score
- create reset / start button
